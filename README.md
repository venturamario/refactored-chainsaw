# Java Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java projects categorized into three levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Java Topics.
All these projects have been coded by myself for the last 4 years

## Basic Level

Projects in this category are designed for beginners who are just starting with Java programming. These projects cover fundamental concepts and provide a gentle introduction to Java development.
These projects can be useful to understand basic java topics

## Intermediate Level

Intermediate level projects are aimed at developers with some experience in Java programming. These projects delve deeper into Java concepts, allowing developers to strengthen their skills and understanding of the language.
These projects can be useful to put into practice concepts such as dynamic memory, arrayLists or basic graphics

## Advanced Java Topics

Advanced Java Topics include projects that explore complex Java concepts and techniques. These projects are suitable for experienced Java developers who want to enhance their expertise and tackle more challenging problems.
These projects use advanced Java topics learnt by myself such as Java Reflection or Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
